I'd be happy to help you log out, but I need a bit more context. Are you asking about:

1. **Logging out of Claude Code** - You can simply close the terminal or press `Ctrl+C` to exit the CLI
2. **Logging out of your Windows session** - You can run `shutdown /l` or use the Start menu
3. **Something else** - Like logging out of a specific application or service

What would you like to log out of?
