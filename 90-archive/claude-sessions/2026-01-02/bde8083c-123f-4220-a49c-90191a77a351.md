I'd be happy to help you log out, but I need a bit more context. Are you asking about:

1. **Logging out of Claude Code CLI** - You can simply close the terminal or press `Ctrl+C` to exit the current session.

2. **Logging out of your Anthropic account** - You can run:
   ```
   claude logout
   ```

3. **Something else** - Like logging out of a service in code you're working on?

Which would you like help with?
